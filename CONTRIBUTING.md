# Contributing to elio

Thank you for your interest in contributing to elio!

Bug reports, feature requests, documentation improvements, preview fixes, and
code changes are welcome.

This guide covers the basics for contributing to the project.

## Getting Started

Install Rust with [rustup](https://rustup.rs/), fork the repository, and clone
your fork:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/elio.git
cd elio
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

The repository includes [`rust-toolchain.toml`](rust-toolchain.toml), so rustup
will use the expected toolchain and components automatically.

## Project Structure

```

If you are not sure where a change belongs, start by reading
[`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md).

## Development Workflow

Build the project:

```bash
cargo build
```

Run `elio`:

```bash
cargo run
```

For configuration and theme work, use the examples in
[`examples/config.toml`](examples/config.toml) and [`examples/themes/`](examples/themes/).

## Local Checks

Before opening a pull request, run the same checks expected by CI:

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo test --locked --test architecture_guardrails
cargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --locked
RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --locked --no-deps
```

## Pull Requests

Keep pull requests focused and easy to review. If you are proposing a larger
feature or behavior change, open an issue or discussion first so the approach can
be discussed before implementation.

Preview and platform behavior can vary by OS, terminal, and available helper
tools. Avoid broad changes in this area, manually test affected behavior, and
mention the OS and terminal in the pull request.

Follow the pull request template and make sure your description explains what
changed, why it changed, and how it was tested.

For user-visible changes, add a short entry under `## [Unreleased]` in
[`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).

## Security

[`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).

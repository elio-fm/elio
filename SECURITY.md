# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are provided for the latest released version of `elio`.

If possible, test suspected vulnerabilities against the newest release before
reporting. If you can only reproduce the issue on an older version, include that
version in the report.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open a public GitHub issue for suspected security
vulnerabilities.

Report vulnerabilities through GitHub private vulnerability reporting for this
repository:

<https://github.com/elio-fm/elio/security/advisories/new>

When reporting, please include:

- the affected `elio` version or commit
- your operating system and terminal
- a clear description of the issue
- reproduction steps or a proof of concept, when possible
- whether the issue depends on a crafted file, archive, path, config, theme, or
  terminal escape sequence
- whether the issue depends on optional external preview tools

We aim to acknowledge new reports within 7 days. Reports will be triaged, and
confirmed vulnerabilities will be fixed and disclosed with appropriate release
notes once a fix is available.

## Project Security Scope

`elio` is a local terminal file manager. It does not run a server, accept remote
logins, or intentionally process untrusted network requests.

Security-sensitive areas include:

- previewing malformed or malicious local files, archives, documents, media, or
  images
- invoking optional external preview tools
- opening files or folders with platform launchers and discovered applications
- handling unusual filenames, paths, symlinks, mounts, and trash operations
- copying file metadata to the clipboard, including through OSC52 and platform
  clipboard helpers
- rendering terminal output, including terminal escape sequences
- parsing user-provided config and theme files

If you are unsure whether a behavior is security-sensitive, report it privately.

## Dependency Advisories

Rust dependency advisories are reviewed during maintenance and release work. If
your report concerns a dependency advisory, include the advisory ID, affected
versions, and any known impact on `elio`.

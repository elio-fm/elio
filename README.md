## Installation

### Arch Linux

Install from the AUR with your preferred AUR helper:

```bash
paru -S elio
```

### Fedora

Enable the COPR repository and install with `dnf`:

```bash
sudo dnf copr enable miguelregueiro/elio
sudo dnf install elio
```

### Debian and Ubuntu-based Linux

Configure the official apt repository and install with `apt`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://elio-fm.github.io/elio-apt/install.sh | sudo sh
sudo apt install elio
```

Manual repository setup is available in [`elio-apt`](https://github.com/elio-fm/elio-apt). To install without adding a repository, download `elio_amd64.deb` from the [latest release](https://github.com/elio-fm/elio/releases/latest).

The apt repository currently publishes `amd64` packages.

### Homebrew

Install from Homebrew:

```bash
brew install elio
```

### Cargo

Install from crates.io:

```bash
cargo install elio
```

`elio` starts in your current working directory by default. Pass a file or directory path to open it instead.

> [!TIP]
> Recommended: use a Nerd Font in your terminal so icons display correctly.

## Image Previews

Inline visual previews, including images, covers, thumbnails, and rendered pages, work automatically on supported terminals.

| Terminal | Protocol | Status |
|---|---|---|
| [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) | Kitty Graphics Protocol | ✓ Auto-detected |
| [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/) | Kitty Graphics Protocol | ✓ Auto-detected |
| [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) | Kitty direct-placement protocol | ✓ Auto-detected |
| [WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/) | iTerm2 Inline Protocol | ✓ Auto-detected |
| [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) | iTerm2 Inline Protocol | ✓ Auto-detected |
| [Konsole](https://konsole.kde.org/) | Kitty direct-placement protocol | ✓ Auto-detected |
| [foot](https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot) | Sixel | ✓ Auto-detected |
| [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) | Sixel | ✓ Auto-detected |
| Alacritty | — | Not supported |
| Other | Kitty Graphics Protocol | Set `ELIO_IMAGE_PREVIEWS=1` to enable |

> Sixel terminals can render large or first-time previews more slowly than Kitty Graphics or iTerm2 Inline backends.
>
> In Konsole, inline previews are temporarily cleared while modal popups are open to avoid rendering artifacts.

Useful environment variables:

<details>
<summary><strong>Environment Variables</strong></summary>

| Variable | Effect |

| `ELIO_DEBUG_PREVIEW` | Log image preview activity to `elio-preview.log` in the system temp directory |

## Preview Coverage

elio previews many file types:

- Text, source code, Markdown, logs, and structured data such as JSON, YAML, TOML, CSV/TSV, and SQLite
- Documents such as PDFs, ebooks, Office files, OpenDocument files, and Apple Pages
- Images, audio, and video metadata, with inline images, covers, and thumbnails when supported
- Folders, archives, comic archives, torrents, ISO images, and other container-style files
- Fonts, binary files, and other metadata-focused previews

See the preview docs:
https://elio-fm.github.io/docs/previews/

---

## Optional Preview Tools

elio works out of the box. Optional tools unlock richer previews:

- `poppler` for PDFs
- `ffmpeg` / `ffprobe` for media metadata and thumbnails
- `resvg` for SVG previews
- 7-Zip for more archive types, comic archives, and RAR support

See the optional tools docs:
https://elio-fm.github.io/docs/optional-tools/

---

## Using elio over SSH

elio works over SSH. For the best experience, use a supported terminal and install optional tools on the remote host.

Opening files with terminal apps works normally inside SSH sessions. Desktop apps may open files on the remote host or do nothing useful.

---

## Change Directory on Quit

elio can leave your shell in the directory you were browsing when you quit:

```bash
elio shell install
```

Restart your shell, then run `elio` normally. Press `q` to quit and move your shell to elio's final directory, or `Q` to quit without changing directories.

See the shell integration docs for uninstall steps, supported shells, and manual setup:
https://elio-fm.github.io/docs/shell-integration/

---

## Configuration

elio reads configuration from:

| Platform | Config file |
|---|---|
| Linux / BSD | `~/.config/elio/config.toml` or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/elio/config.toml` |
| macOS | `~/.config/elio/config.toml` or `~/Library/Application Support/elio/config.toml` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\elio\config.toml` |

See [`examples/config.toml`](examples/config.toml) for an annotated example, or the configuration docs:
https://elio-fm.github.io/docs/configuration/

---

## Theming

elio themes are TOML files layered on top of the built-in defaults, so you only need to set the keys you want to change.

| Platform | Theme file |
|---|---|
| Linux / BSD | `~/.config/elio/theme.toml` or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/elio/theme.toml` |
| macOS | `~/.config/elio/theme.toml` or `~/Library/Application Support/elio/theme.toml` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\elio\theme.toml` |

See [`assets/themes/default/theme.toml`](assets/themes/default/theme.toml) for the full default theme and [`examples/themes/`](examples/themes/) for ready-made themes.

For transparent or terminal-palette setups, see [`examples/themes/transparent/theme.toml`](examples/themes/transparent/theme.toml) and [`examples/themes/terminal-ansi/theme.toml`](examples/themes/terminal-ansi/theme.toml).
